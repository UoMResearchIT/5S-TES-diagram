for displaying on github pages.

This repo contains scripts and source files for generating a C4 diagram of 
the stack.

The `create.sh` script wraps the LikeC4 Docker container to provide easy use
of the LikeC4 tooling.

```

### Commands

- `server`: Launch the interactive LikeC4 server for diagram editing and visualisation.
- `export`: Run the LikeC4 tool for exporting images
- `build`: Run the LikeC4 tool for building a static website

- Docker must be installed and running.

### Notes

- The built side can be viewed by moving to the generated `dist` directory and running:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
